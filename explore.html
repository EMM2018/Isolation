									<h4>How did It feel?</h4>
									<p><i> It felt good overall. </i></p>
									<h4>What did you experience?</h4>
									<p><i> It is weird not being able to see your hand when you put it right in front of you, but after a while your brain makes it seem like you can see your hand. I would think there is a faint light in the corner. Almost as if there was a door there, but there really wasn’t. </i></p>
									<h4>Did you think about anything?</h4>
									<p><i> I thought about if this is what dieing is like, it's nice. Just laying there in the dark forever. Maybe death is more peaceful than people make it out to be. </i></p>
									<h4>If you were to stay in here longer, what do you think it would be like?</h4>
									<p><i> It felt very quick, like only 10 minutes had passed. I didn’t have a sense of time in there. I wouldn’t know it was even an hour.</i></p>
									<h4>What do you think it would be like to live like this permanently?</h4>
									<p><i> I have no idea. I honestly have zero idea. I freaked out for the first minute. It freaks you out in the beginning and then you just calm down. Most of the scary effects probably happen later than an hour, but I was still confused and freaked out when you guys came in after the hour. So I can't imagine what it's like for people who go to the woods for like a week and then come back. There's so much stimulation when you come back out.  </i></p>
									<h4>Did you hear anything?</h4>
									<p><i> I heard a lot of ambient noise. It’s almost like when you are on an airplane. When you are here for a while just laying there, you start to hear it. Maybe your brain creates it because there is not enough stimulus in here. </i></p>
									<h4>Would you do it again?</h4>
									<p><i> Yes, it felt nice. I am a happy person and whenever I get cranky it’s typically because of other people. </i></p>
									<h4>Would you say you were in a meditative state?</h4>
									<p><i> Yes, but it may depend on the person. But it also may depend on the fact that I knew you were both right there. And I knew I was going to leave in a little bit. It comes in waves what you feel. Overall I felt a sense of calm and niceness, but sometimes you'll get the thought of “what if I am staying in here for forever” or “is that something that I see” and you cringe a little. I started to daydream a little and they were a lot more loud and realistic in here because your thoughts are the only noise. It would have felt different if the lights weren't off. You end up just staring at the ceiling for a long time, almost dreaming, but you don't notice it because of the darkness.</i></p> 
									<h4>Did you at any time lose your sense of self?</h4>
									<p><i> No. There were times when I felt really calm. Even right now my body is almost very tingly. If dieing is like nothing. If you feel nothing after you die, I don't think it is that bad. Yeah definitely. I definitely didn't have an unworldly audio or visual stimulation though. I didn’t feel that way. </i></p>
									<h4>Do you think your mindset coming in affected how your experience was?</h4>
									<p><i> Probably. I was fine with it. Beforehand I got a little nervous because I didn’t actually know what it was going to be like. I think the thing that affected me the most was how I knew it wasn’t going to be forever. Even when I thought “what if this is forever” I really knew that it was for a fixed amount of time. </i></p>
