									<h2><u>Definition:</u><h3>"A state of solitude or being alone"<h3></h2>
									<p></p>
									<p>It is one thing to define loneliness in words, but another to explain the ways we can end up feeling lonely. Listed below are the easily identifiable types of loneliness our group came up with: </p>
									
									<h4>Type 1</h4>
									<p> Being physically surrounded by friends and family and not feeling emotionally lonely </p>
									
									<h4>Type 2</h4>
									<p>Being both emotionally and physically alone</p>
									
									<h4>Type 3</h4>
									<p>Being emotionally alone but not physically alone</p>
									
									<h4>Type 4</h4>
									<p>Being physically laone but not emotionally alone</p>
									
									<h2><u>Discussion:</u></h2>
									<p>Acknowledging we all experience these forms of loneliness at one
									point or another in out lives, we decided to dive deeper and research 
									the impacts and causes of these feelings. During our research we were 
									able to identify two forms of loneliness:</p>
									
									<p>Form one is that of constructive loneliness. A self-isolation, or form
									of loneliness, which fosters thought and potential inspiration. An extremely
									beneficial form of loneliness, so long as it is temporary. It has been found 
									that, when experiencing a
									cyclic form of loneliness, it is possible for negative side effects to
									take over. Negative side effects like those which can come from the second type
									of loneliness</p>
									
									<p>Form two is, in contrast, destructive loneliness. Destructive loneliness can 
									come from an attempt at constructive loneliness, or from forced loneliness or isolation. 
									As can be found in our infographic on the Explore page, there is a direct link between 
									solitary confinement and adverse health effects, ranging from increases in suicide to 
									excess rage, panic, or hostility. It is easy to see how one can be negatively affected 
									by involuntary isolation.</p>
									
									<p>From our experiment we were able to see that what causes the feeling of loneliness is not the same for every person.
									For the more socially-inclined, moments separated from people may be the end of the world. For those who are introverted,
									it is possible that being surrounded by people results in them feeling more isolated than ever. Being connected
									with others is something we all strive to do; It is the human way. </p>
									
									<h2><u>Conclusion:</u></h2>
									<p> There is no one source or cause for the feelings of loneliness with which we live. Having delved into what loneliness is, 
									the forms it can take, and the causes it has, it is our hope that you will be able to learn to adapt to, or overcome, your own loneliness.
									Loneliness is a feeling, an emotion, a state of being. Loneliness is not a curse; it is an opportunity for introspection and
									self-improvement.</p>
